# Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)

Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) models civilizations as **self-consistent causal systems**, rather than biological, cultural, or technological entities.

Under this view, independently evolved civilizations are **structurally incompatible** at the causal level, making direct communication impossible. Any meaningful interaction therefore requires a **Third Causal System (TCS)** — a neutral causal substrate jointly constructed by both sides.

CCT provides a structural framework for reasoning about:
- Cross-civilizational communication
- The Fermi Paradox
- Agent civilizations and long-term survival
- The limits of translation, alignment, and contact

## Overview

A concise, top-down overview of the complete CCT framework — from embodied civilizations to agent civilizations and the necessity of TCS.

→ **[Read the Overview](./overview.md)**

## Core Concepts

The following concepts form the structural backbone of CCT.  
Some pages are still under preparation; the list reflects the **intended complete framework**.

- Embodied Civilizations (L0)
- Agent Civilizations (L1)
- Third Causal System (TCS)
- Causal Incompatibility
- Minimal Shared Causal Substrate (MSCS)
- Structural vs. Semantic Alignment
- Communication as Causal Co-construction
- Virtualization and Inward Convergence
- Civilization as a Time-Bound Causal Process
