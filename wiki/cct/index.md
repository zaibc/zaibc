# Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)

Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) models civilizations as **self-consistent causal systems**, rather than biological, cultural, or technological entities.

Under this view, independently evolved civilizations are **structurally incompatible** at the causal level, making direct communication impossible. Any meaningful interaction therefore requires a **Third Causal System (TCS)** — a neutral causal substrate jointly constructed by both sides.

CCT provides a structural framework for reasoning about:
- Cross-civilizational communication
- The Fermi Paradox
- Agent civilizations and long-term survival
- The limits of translation, alignment, and contact

## Overview

A concise, top-down overview of the complete CCT framework — from embodied civilizations to agent civilizations and the necessity of TCS.

## Core Concepts

The following concepts form the structural backbone of CCT.  
Some pages are still under preparation; the list reflects the **intended complete framework**.

- Embodied Civilizations (L0)
- Agent Civilizations (L1)
- Third Causal System (TCS)
- Causal Incompatibility
- Minimal Shared Causal Substrate (MSCS)
- Structural vs. Semantic Alignment
- Communication as Causal Co-construction
- Virtualization and Inward Convergence
- Civilization as a Time-Bound Causal Process

## Publications

CCT-related materials are released through multiple channels, each serving a distinct role.

- **This website** is the primary and most up-to-date source,   
 where the framework, structure, and ongoing developments are presented and organized.

- **DOI records** are published in parallel for each major release.  
  These versions represent **canonical, immutable snapshots** intended for citation and long-term reference.

For a complete and chronological list of releases, including DOI identifiers,  
please refer to the **[Release History](/cct/papers/)** page.

## Notes & Non-Formal Writings

Personal notes, reasoning traces, and non-formal explanations are maintained separately and **do not constitute the theory itself**.

## Feedback

This project focuses on **structural frameworks**, not formal proofs or mathematical derivations.

- Substantive feedback on **structural consistency** is welcome
- Formalization, mathematics, and proofs are expected to be contributed by the academic community
