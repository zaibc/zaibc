# Preface

`Please note`: This manuscript is a personal record of the author’s thinking. Its purpose is to preserve the reasoning paths, intuitive judgments, and phased understandings that emerged during the formation of Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) and its related ideas. It is not a formally structured or fully systematized theoretical treatise.

The motivation for writing this book originated from an “accident” that was never part of the original plan. While reasoning through a completely unrelated task, I unexpectedly arrived at the core framework of CCT (Civilization Causality Theory). This discovery forced me to reorganize nearly all of my long-held views on civilization, consciousness, meaning, and the future.

This book is not an extended explanation of the CCT paper itself, nor is it a patchwork of annotations added onto existing viewpoints. More accurately, it represents the inevitable intellectual overflow that follows the birth of CCT. When a conceptual framework becomes powerful enough to reorder your cognitive structure, it naturally expands outward, giving rise to new questions, new insights, and new perspectives.

The moment we first understand civilization as a *causal system*, a profound consequence immediately emerges:<br />
our intuitions about the self, about others, about communication, about the future, and even about “meaning” itself must all be re-examined. This is not because the theory is radical, but because it touches the cognitive foundations we have long taken for granted without ever truly questioning.

CCT does not attempt to replace philosophy, physics, linguistics, or theories of artificial intelligence. Quite the opposite—it places these seemingly disparate fields within the same structural layer, allowing many previously unrelated problems to receive a unified explanation for the first time. Therefore, some of the conclusions that appear in this book—such as the impossibility of direct civilization alignment, the inevitability of TCS, experience as the core of meaning, and the necessary trajectory of virtual civilizations—are not subjective speculations. They are logical consequences that naturally flow from the framework itself.

These conclusions were not pre-designed by the author. They emerged on their own once all the components were closed and internally consistent. In other words:<br />
this is not “personal reflection,” but the cognitive shockwave produced by a theory after it becomes self-consistent.

While reading this book, I hope you will view it as:
- An extension of thinking based on CCT  
- A re-examination of the essence of civilization  
- A structured reasoning about possible evolutionary paths of the future  
- And a gentle yet profound challenge to one’s worldview  

Those who truly understand this framework rarely remain intellectually unchanged.

The author is no exception.
