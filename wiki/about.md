# About Zaibc

**Zaibc** is a personal, independent research space based in New Zealand.

It exists to publish and host theoretical frameworks such as 
**Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)** and related work, including 
**Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT)** (in preparation), and to provide a stable reference point for their discussion and development.

**Zaibc** is not a research institution, funding body, or academic authority.   
It functions solely as a publication and coordination space for ideas.

## Meaning of the Name

The name **Zaibc** originates from the Chinese phrase **“在别处”**
(*“elsewhere”*).

It reflects a core attitude behind the work published here:

> Truth may always be elsewhere.  
> Any structure must remain open to negation.

This stance—continuous self-negation and readiness to revise—is fundamental
to both the theories presented and the author’s approach.

## Scope of Work

- **Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)**  
  The first theory proposed under **Zaibc**, addressing civilizations as
  self-consistent causal systems and the structural limits of inter-civilizational
  understanding.

- **Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT)**  
  A second framework currently in preparation, examining the structural conditions that make the discovery of theories such as CCT possible.  
  SRT is concerned not with specific conclusions, but with how new structural frameworks can be formed in the first place.

Future work may extend or revise these directions, but no fixed roadmap is imposed.
