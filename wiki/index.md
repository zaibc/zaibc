# Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) 

> CCT treats civilizations as self-consistent causal systems,   
> and derives consequences from structural constraints rather than observation. 

- Why advanced civilizations may converge inward rather than expand or communicate. [*[read more](/cct/overview)*] 
- Why the Fermi Paradox is not a paradox under structural constraints. [*[read more](/essays/20251217-the-fermi-paradox-is-not-a-paradox-a-structural-perspective)*] 
- Why any possible contact, if it exists, would have to be non-semantic, minimal, and indirect. [*[read more](/essays/20251218-ufos-as-a-structural-phenomenon)*]

# Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT)

> SRT explains **how structural theories like CCT become possible at all**—by identifying the minimal architecture required for intelligence to generate and stabilize structure.
