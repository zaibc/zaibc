# Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)

> Chinese version provided [here](/start/cn/).

## What is CCT

**Civilization Causality Theory (CCT)** proposes a structural view of civilization:

> A civilization is best modeled not as a biological, cultural, or technological entity,  
> but as a **self-consistent causal system**.

From this perspective, civilizations evolve, interact, and terminate according to the internal
constraints of their causal structures — not merely by intention, ethics, or technology.

CCT is not a speculative narrative.  
It is a **structural framework** that derives its conclusions from causal consistency and alignment constraints.

## What Problems Does CCT Address?

CCT focuses on two fundamentally different layers of civilization:

#### L0 — Embodied Civilizations

At the level of **embodied civilizations** (L0), where causal processes remain bound to non-transferable substrates, CCT addresses:

- Why most civilizations do **not** expand or communicate at cosmic scale  
- Why long-term continuity is structurally constrained by time, scale, and irreversibility  
- Why **virtualization and inward convergence** are more stable end states than outward expansion  

These structural conclusions provide explanations for:

- The Fermi Paradox  
- The absence of observable large-scale astroengineering  
- The persistent silence of advanced civilizations  

#### L1 / L2 — Agent Civilizations & Communication
At higher layers, CCT examines civilizations that attempt to overcome L0 limitations:

- **L1**: Agent civilizations created to overcome scale and time constraints (search, exploration)
- **L2**: The **Third Causal System (TCS / MSCS)** — the minimal shared causal substrate required for communication

CCT shows that:

- Independently evolved civilizations possess **incompatible internal causal semantics**
- Finite signaling cannot align these semantics
- Direct translation is structurally impossible
- Communication requires **joint construction of a neutral causal system**

This reframes:
- Interstellar communication
- “Contact” ambiguity
- Limitations of hostility-based models (e.g. simplistic Dark Forest assumptions)

## How Is This Different from Existing Answers?

Most existing explanations (e.g. Dark Forest, Rare Earth, Self-Destruction) rely on:
- Behavioral assumptions
- Probabilistic filters
- Sociological speculation

CCT differs in one key way:

> Its conclusions follow from **structural constraints**, not preference-based hypotheses.

If the causal structure holds, the outcomes are not optional.

## How to Read This Site

This site is organized to serve different audiences:

#### 📄 Academic Readers
- Formal definitions, structure, and claims are presented as papers
- Each major component is published with DOI records
- arXiv submissions correspond to specific sections of this site

👉 Start with **Laws & Framework**  
👉 See **Publications / DOI** for citable versions

#### 📘 General Readers & Thought Process
If you are interested in **how the theory was derived**, rather than only the final structure:

- Personal notes and essays are available under **Notes**
- These are not formal theory texts
- They document the reasoning path, intuition, and intermediate reflections

👉 Visit **[Notes](/notes/)** (non-technical, narrative-oriented)

#### 💬 Feedback & Academic Contribution

CCT welcomes **structural feedback** and independent academic work.

- Feedback is expected to focus on causal structure, necessity, and internal consistency
- Preference-based disagreement or semantic debate is outside scope
- Formalization, proofs, and extensions are encouraged — but belong to the contributor

The author does not claim ownership over future development of the theory.  
CCT is presented as a framework to be examined, challenged, and extended by the academic community.

👉 See **[Feedback](/feedback)**

## Status & Scope

- CCT is presented as an **open structural framework**
- Some components are complete at the structural level
- Others are intentionally left as research directions

The author’s role is to:
- Present the framework
- Clarify its internal logic
- Enable further work

Not to:
- Exhaust all formal details
- Serve as a permanent spokesperson
- Resolve every downstream implication

## Where to Go Next

- **Start with the Laws** → understand the structural backbone  
- **Explore L0 or L1/L2 tracks** depending on interest  
- **Read [Notes](/notes/)** for narrative context  
- **Consult papers / DOI** for formal reference  

> Direction, once aligned, no longer depends on the individual.
