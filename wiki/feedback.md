# Feedback & Academic Contribution

This site primarily accepts **structural feedback** on Civilization Causality Theory (CCT).

CCT is proposed as a **causal framework**, not as a fully formalized or completed theory.
Its purpose is to introduce a new structural perspective and to open research directions,
not to exhaustively resolve all downstream details.


## What Kind of Feedback Is Welcome

Feedback is welcome **only** when it engages with the theory at the structural level, including:

- Challenges to the **causal assumptions** used in the framework  
- Arguments that identify **structural inconsistencies or contradictions**  
- Counterexamples that would invalidate a proposed necessity (e.g. L1, TCS)  
- Questions that expose missing structural constraints  

In other words:  
**If a feedback could potentially falsify or reshape the structure, it is welcome.**


## What Is Outside the Scope

The author does **not** engage in:

- Mathematical formalization or proofs  
- Model training, simulation, or implementation  
- Optimization, engineering, or algorithm design  
- Endless semantic debates or preference-based arguments  

These are essential research directions — but they belong to the **academic community**, not to the author’s role in this project.


## Academic Contribution

CCT is intentionally published as an **open framework**.

Researchers, institutions, or independent scholars are encouraged to:

- Formalize parts of the framework (logic, mathematics, causal graphs)
- Propose alternative constructions or refutations
- Extend the theory into subdomains
- Publish independent work building on or challenging CCT

All such work is considered **the contributor’s own academic contribution**, not derivative ownership.


## Contact

For meaningful structural feedback or academic inquiries, please contact:

📧 **feedback@zaibc.com**

Please note:
- Replies are not guaranteed
- Only structurally relevant inquiries will be considered

CCT does not require universal agreement.  
It requires only that its structure withstands serious challenge.
