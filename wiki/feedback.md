# Feedback & Academic Engagement

Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) is presented as a **structural and conceptual framework**.

The scope of this project is intentionally limited.

It does **not** aim to provide:
- Mathematical proofs  
- Formal symbolic systems  
- Empirical validation  
- Simulations or experimental results  

Those directions are left to the academic community.

---

## Scope of Acceptable Feedback

The author welcomes **structural-level feedback only**, including:

- Internal coherence and consistency of the framework  
- Completeness or incompleteness of the proposed structure  
- Identification of missing, redundant, or unnecessary layers  
- Structural contradictions or incompatibilities  
- Arguments that invalidate, replace, or subsume a proposed structure  
- High-level alignment or misalignment between components  
  (e.g. *Embodied Civilizations / Agent Civilizations / TCS*)

Feedback that primarily requests:
- Mathematical formalization  
- Proof obligations  
- Empirical testing  
- Simulation results  

falls **outside the author’s scope** and may not receive a response.

## On “Contributions”

CCT is offered as a **directional framework**, not as a closed or owned theory.

Any formalization efforts — including:
- Mathematical models  
- Logical systems  
- Computational implementations  
- Empirical or experimental studies  

are understood to be **independent academic work**.

Researchers are encouraged to:
- Develop their own formal treatments  
- Publish under their own authorship  
- Critically assess, extend, or replace parts of the framework  

All contributors retain **full ownership** of their work.

This project does not act as a review board, gatekeeper, or approving authority.

## Communication

If you believe you have identified:
- A structural flaw  
- A critical omission  
- A decisive incompatibility  
- Or a meaningful structural extension  

you may contact the author at:

**Email:** `feedback@zaibc.com`

Please focus on the **structural point itself** and keep the message concise.

Messages centered on proof requests, validation demands, or implementation details are unlikely to receive a response.

## Author’s Role and Limits

The author’s involvement is limited to:

- Clarifying the intended meaning of structural concepts  
- Confirming whether a critique targets the correct abstraction level  
- Acknowledging unresolved or open structural questions  

The author does **not** commit to:

- Producing formal proofs  
- Translating the framework into mathematical systems  
- Participating in extended technical or adversarial debates

> This framework opens a direction.  
> Formal paths beyond it are not centrally owned.
