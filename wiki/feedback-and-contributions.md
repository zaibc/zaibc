# Feedback & Contributions

This project is concerned with **structural and conceptual frameworks only**.

The author does **not** provide mathematical proofs, formal derivations,
or full symbolic formulations of the theory.

## Scope of Discussion

Acceptable feedback and discussion are limited to:

- Structural coherence and consistency
- Conceptual completeness of the framework
- Identification of missing or redundant structural elements
- Arguments that invalidate or replace a proposed structure
- High-level alignment or misalignment between components (e.g., L0 / L1 / TCS)

Requests for mathematical rigor, formal proofs, simulations,
or empirical validation fall outside the author’s scope.

## Contributions

The Civilization Causality Theory (CCT) is presented as a **structural framework**.

Formalization—including mathematics, logic systems, computational models,
or experimental designs—is explicitly left to the academic community.

Contributions are welcome if they:

- Attempt to formalize parts of the framework
- Propose alternative structures addressing the same problem space
- Demonstrate incompatibility between the framework and known formal results

All contributors retain full ownership of their work.
This project does not act as a governing or approving authority.

## Communication

If you believe you have identified a structural issue or a meaningful extension,
you may contact the author:

**Email:** `feedback@zaibc.com`

Please describe the structural point concisely.
Messages focused on proof requests or formal validation may not receive a response.

## Author’s Role

The author’s involvement is limited to:

- Clarifying intended meanings of structural concepts
- Confirming whether a critique targets the correct level of the framework
- Acknowledging unresolved or open structural questions

The author does not commit to:

- Providing proofs or equations
- Translating the framework into formal systems
- Participating in extended technical debates
