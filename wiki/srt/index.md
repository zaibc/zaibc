# Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT)

Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT) is a framework for understanding **how genuinely new structures are discovered**,  
and why intelligence cannot be reduced to scale, data, or optimization.

SRT explains **why theories like CCT become possible in the first place**.

→ Read the **[SRT White Paper](/srt/srt-white-paper-v1)**

SRT focuses on structure-first reasoning, pre-logical constraint discovery, 
and the separation between unrestricted thinking and constrained execution.
