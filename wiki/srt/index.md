# Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT)

Structural Reasoning Theory (SRT) is a **meta-theoretical framework** that examines *how structural discoveries such as CCT become possible in the first place.*

SRT does not extend CCT. It explains its **origin**. It focuses on:
- structure-first reasoning
- pre-logical constraint discovery
- why certain theories emerge outside established academic pipelines

SRT is currently under active reflection and is **not presented as a formal theory or publication roadmap**.

> Early fragments of SRT are recorded in the Notes section as part of the author’s self-analysis during CCT’s development.
